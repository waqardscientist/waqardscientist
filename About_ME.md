👋 Hi there! I'm Waqar Shamim, and I'm super excited about learning Machine Learning and Data Science. I used to work in retail planning and supply chain, but I've decided to switch things up and dive into the world of data.

📚 I'm always learning new stuff, like how to use cool algorithms and analyze data to make smart decisions. I really believe that data is like a superpower that can help us understand things better.

🔍 On my GitHub, I'm like a scientist in a lab, trying out different things with data. I share what I learn and work with others who also love playing with data.

🚀 I went from planning in retail to playing with data, and that journey taught me a lot about solving problems. I like finding solutions that make a real difference using numbers and patterns.

🌟 Wanna join me? I'm on a mission to get even better at Machine Learning and Data Science. Let's learn together and use data to do some really cool things! If you're into data, coding, or anything in between, I'd love to connect. 
Let's explore the world of data and make awesome things happen! 🚀📊💡
